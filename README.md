# Oxide-Plugins
A collection of my public Oxide plugins.

## Setting up environment
By default every plugin copies its output to a local rust server's oxide plugins directory. **It's dependant on a environment variable called %RustServerDev%.** It assumes the server identity is the default one (my_server_identity).

### Releases
